Welcome to the User help menu!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Create new profiles by ticking on the squares that the user can use <br/>
and ticking off the ones he mustn't (and therfore can't!).<br/>
Next click on the button 'create new user' located at the bottom of the screen, <br/>
and you'll be redirected to the page where you can fill in the needed information.<br/>
<br/>
Voila a new account has been made!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!
