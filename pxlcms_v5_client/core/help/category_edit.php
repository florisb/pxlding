Welcome to the Category Edit help menu!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is where you can change the properties of you categories.<br/>
However, not every CMS or website has this option.<br/>
The category option can mean two things:<br/>
<br/>
First thing<br/>
Just a folder which contains all the pages pages similar to the subject of the folder.<br/>
<br/>
Second thing:<br/>
A menu in a menu in a menu and so on, this is when categories are really needed, because they are implented on the website!<br/> 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck
