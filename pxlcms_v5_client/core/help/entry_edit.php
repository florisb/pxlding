Welcome to the Edit Entry help menu!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's with the easy matters!<br/>
Every textinput field in the menu can be filled with information.<br/>
If you click in the open space where the date needs to stand, a calandar will appear.<br/>
Choose the month, the year and click on one of the days of the calandar to set your date.<br/>
Once you've done this, the date wille change to the newly inserted data<br/>
<br/>
This concludes the easy matters, which therefore brings us to the slightly harder matters.<br/>
The next textinput field is ment for the actual content of the site, there's no need for a titel,<br/> 
perhaps maybe a subtitle, because you've already filled that in the textinput field under title.<br/>
<br/>
You should see some interesting features in the toolbar above the textinput field, not quite so different from some of the basic features in Microsoft Words.<br/>
When you rest your mouse on these icons a self-explaining text will appear. Nevertheless we will explore the icons, <br/>
that need so, a bit further.<br/>
<br/>
<div style='height: 16px; width: 16px; overflow: hidden; background: url(includes\fckeditor\editor\skins\office2003\fck_strip.gif) 0px 1168px;' alt='Source icon' title='Source icon' style='' /></div>
Source; With this button you can see some part of the HyperText Markup Language or html code, if you are experienced with this code,<br/> 
source is the way to improve your text, but it's also fun to see for everybody who's interested in learning a bit html.<br/> 
If you want to go back, just click on source again.<br/>
<br/>
<div style='height: 16px; width: 16px; overflow: hidden; background: url(includes\fckeditor\editor\skins\office2003\fck_strip.gif) 0px 1008px;'alt='Paste from Word icon' title='Paste from Word icon' style='' /></div>
Paste from word; If you copy-paste a text from Microsoft Words, the text will reform in the text space.<br/> 
Therefore if you need to paste something you've copied in Word, press this icon and it will be done!<br/> 
<br/>
<div style='height: 16px; width: 16px; overflow: hidden; background: url(includes\fckeditor\editor\skins\office2003\fck_strip.gif) 0px 912px;'alt='Replace icon' title='Replace icon' style='' /></div>
Replace; If you need to change a name, for example if you have a site about Jennifer Lopez or some other celebrity who frequently changes his/her name.<br/>
You can click on this icon and fill the name in you want to replace, fill the name in you want to replace it with and your done!<br/> 
Can save a lot of man hours.<br/>
<br/>
<div style='height: 16px; width: 16px; overflow: hidden; background: url(includes\fckeditor\editor\skins\office2003\fck_strip.gif) 0px 880px;'alt='Change format icon' title='Change format icon' style='' /></div>
Change format; If you aren't satisfied with your format you can change it back to neutral, <br/>
just make a selection of a few words, sentences or select the entire text and click this icon.<br/>
Now you can reformat your selected text.<br/>
<br/>
<div style='height: 16px; width: 16px; overflow: hidden; background: url(includes\fckeditor\editor\skins\office2003\fck_strip.gif) 0px 640px;'alt='Insert/Edit link icon' title='Insert/Edit link icon' style='' /></div>
Insert/Edit link; If you want a word, a sentence or a domain name to form a link to transport you to an anchor (see the explanation on Insert/Edit anchor) in the document,<br/>
to an other website or to an other anchor on an other page in your own website, select the chosen words and click on this icon.<br/>
These words will now form a hallway between two places online!<br/>
<br/>
<div style='height: 16px; width: 16px; overflow: hidden; background: url(includes\fckeditor\editor\skins\office2003\fck_strip.gif) 0px 624px;'alt='Remove link icon' title='Remove link icon' style='' /></div>
Remove link; The same like before, but now the opposite. Select the link you want to un-link and click on this icon<br/>
<br/>
<div style='height: 16px; width: 16px; overflow: hidden; background: url(includes\fckeditor\editor\skins\office2003\fck_strip.gif) 0px 608px;'alt='Insert/Edit anchor icon' title='Insert/Edit anchor icon' style='' /></div>
Insert/Edit anchor; You can anchor a selection of a word or a sentence in a document by clicking on this icon.<br/>
You must then link this anchor to another word in this document with insert/edit link.<br/>
This can be used if you have a long page with many subtitles. Anchor all this subtitles and link them to an index at the top of the page.
To remove this anchor click on the insert/edit anchor icon again.<br/>
<br/>
<div style='height: 16px; width: 16px; overflow: hidden; background: url(includes\fckeditor\editor\skins\office2003\fck_strip.gif) 0px 512px;'alt='Insert special character icon' title='Insert special character icon' style='' /></div>
Insert special character; Just click on this icon for special characters.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To upload images, if this particular Edit Entry menu supports this function, click on the button 'browse photo', you will be redirected to own hard disk to upload it.<br/>
Find your image, confirm and it will be uploaded to the websites database, a miniature image will now be seen in the Edit entry menu.<br/>
If this didn't work, the image was mostly likely to big to upload and therefore needs to be customized.<br/>
Change the extension of the image on your harddisk to jpeg and you should be oke, then try it again.<br/>
<br/>
Next to the miniature image you can fill in a textinput field with a description of the image.<br/>
This description is required, because if for some personal reason a visitor can't see the images,<br/> 
he will still see a text if he hovers above the image with his mouse pointer and therefore will receive the same information an other vistor would get.<br/>
<br/>
Below the photo upload entry you'll find an (optional) text referring to more upload possibilities.<br/>
If the text says: No more images can be uploaded here (the maximum number of images is *).<br/>
It means you need to reconsider which images are most important to land on your website.<br/>
If you insist on the possibility to put more images in this entry call us at 023-5323432, we will be happy to help you!<br/>
<br/>
Now comes the most important button in this entry: 'Save entry'<br/>
If you haven't saved your entry and you'll go to an other page in the CMS, you will lose the information you've just added!<br/>
So try to frequently save your content.<br/>
<br/>
The newly entered information can not be seen online if it isn't saved.<br/>
If you have your site online and you want to see your adjustments, just press 'ctrl F5' on your keypad and see your artwork!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>
