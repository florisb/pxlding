Welcome to your content management system!<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that the CMS resembles the skeleton of your website, whilst the website itself represents the body!<br/>
Behind every little piece of skin, there's a bone givin' the skin it's shape and posture.<br/>
Off course there's also the concept of muscles and fat, but those are the parts we've already taken care of!<br/>
The purpose of this metaphore is make you understand, that the build-up of your CMS is sort of equal to that of your website.<br/>
And with this CMS you can change the look and feel of your entire website, all except for design and functions.<br/>
<br/>
On the left side you will see the menu 'Menu' which contains the same navigation menu you have on your website.<br/>
Below 'Menu' you'll see all those different menus, if you click on one of them, a pull down menu will be revealed, <br/>
with all the different pages this menu on your website consists of.<br/>
To edit a page click on it, you will be redirected to 'Module Overview' where you can edit the content of the page you've just clicked on.<br/>
<br/>
In the top right corner you'll see 5 icons, the first one and the last two speak for themselves.<br/>
The 'News' icon will contain newsitems concerning the internet, selected by the team of Pixelindustries.<br/>
But then we have the 'Users' icon, which of all these icons is probably the most important for you!<br/>
That's where you can create new user accounts for your coworkers, that can be adjusted to owns satisfaction.<br/>
Just tick the squares below the functions of each menu and page to able or the disable the possibilty to change that specific item!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you need more help just click on the help button set in the top right corner of the page you need help with!<br/>
If there are any questions or problems the help function can't answer, just call 023 - 532 34 32 and we will be happy to assist.<br/>

Good luck hosting your website!<br/>

p.s. If you in any circumstances would accidently click on the 'back' button in your internet browser, you will be directed to the log-in screen.<br/>
If this happens just push on the 'forward' button and you'll find yourself once again back on the page you was.<br/>
And most important: Save everything you've edited, otherwise it will be lost, like in case of the subject just discussed.<br/>
